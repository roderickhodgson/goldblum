### An app for the TiLDA Mk3. The badge at #emfcamp. ###

This is a simple, silly app that I made to test out app writing for this platform. Makes use of uGFX for rendering of googley eyes, and micropython-IMU for accelerometer measurements.

Use the TiLDA app store to install. Or upload files manually into apps/roderickhodgson~goldblum/ on your device.
